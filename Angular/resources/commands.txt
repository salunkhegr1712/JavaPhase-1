1) to create a module inside angular use command 

  ---> ng generate module name-of-module 

  folder will get created inside project->src->app 
  and file name willl be : name-of-module.module.ts


2) to create a service you also you can use following command
  that will create a service in user folder and service name will be user

  ---> ng generate service user/user

  angular not automatically create folder for service or class which it does for 
  components so you have to use these values extensivley


3) create a class it also do not create folder automatically

  ---> ng generate cl folder/nameofclass


4) creating class is rather easy

  ---> ng generate c folder/componentName


5) creating directive 

  --> ng generate d folder/component
